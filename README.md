# Final_project_bootcamp
In this repository you can find a final bootcamp app which is called DBF

The name of the project is dbf and is an shortcut for dog is a Best friend, which means dog is human's best friend. 
The project was realized in a three grouped team. We wanted to create an app that would help people find their dream shelter dog, as well as help cross-species, both humans and dogs. We direct this application to shelters so that they can more efficiently find new homes for their charges, and to anyone who needs to find a home for a dog. We mean dogs abandoned by their owners due to natural causes as well as those lost in the war in Ukraine, for example. The application for the time being includes only dogs due to the limited time available for the final project at bootcamp, but may eventually be expanded to include other animal species.
